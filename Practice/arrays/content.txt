1. Basics of Arrays
    ✅ Definition & Representation in memory
    ✅ Static vs Dynamic arrays
    ✅ Indexing (0-based, 1-based)
    ✅ Traversal
    ✅ Input/Output of arrays
    ✅ Updating elements

2. Basic Operations
    ✅ Insertion
    ✅ Deletion
    ✅ Searching (Linear search, Binary search)
    ✅ Finding min/max element
    ✅ Reverse an array
    ✅ Rotate array (left/right)
    ✅ Shift array (left/right)

3. Prefix / Suffix Concepts
    ✅ Prefix sum array
    ✅ Suffix sum array
    ✅ Prefix min/max array
    ✅ Difference array technique
    ✅ Prefix XOR

4. Subarrays & Subsets
    Sum of all subarrays
    Largest subarray sum (Kadane’s algorithm)
    Maximum/minimum product subarray
    Count of subarrays with given sum
    Longest subarray with given sum
    Subarrays with sum divisible by K
    Subsets generation (bitmasking, recursion)

5. Sorting
    ✅ Basic: Bubble, Selection, Insertion
    ✅ Efficient: Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Heap Sort
    ✅ Specialized: Counting sort, Radix sort, Bucket sort
    ✅ Sorting with constraints (sort 0s, 1s, 2s – Dutch National Flag)
    ✅ Sorting based on frequency or custom comparator

6. Searching in Arrays
    ✅ Binary Search variations (first/last occurrence, lower/upper bound)
    ✅ Search in rotated sorted array
    ✅ Search in nearly sorted array
    ✅ Ternary search

7. Sliding Window Technique
    Fixed window problems (max sum of k-length subarray)
    Variable window problems (longest substring with ≤ k distinct elements)
    Sliding window + hashmap/frequency array

8. Two Pointer Technique
    Pair sum problems
    Triplet sum problems
    Move zeros to end
    Segregate positive/negative
    Merge two sorted arrays in O(1) space (gap method)

9. Hashing + Arrays
    Frequency counting
    Index mapping
    Hash-based subarray problems
    Detect duplicates in O(n)

10. Matrix / 2D Arrays
    Traversals (row-wise, column-wise, diagonal)
    Rotate matrix (90°, 180°, 270°)
    Transpose matrix
    Spiral traversal
    Search in sorted 2D matrix
    Prefix sum in 2D arrays (2D cumulative sum)

11. Special Array Problems
    Majority element (Boyer–Moore voting algorithm)
    Leaders in an array
    Stock buy and sell problems
    Trapping rainwater
    Container with most water
    Product of array except self
    Rearranging elements (zigzag, wave)

12. Advanced Data Structures with Arrays
    Segment Tree
    Fenwick Tree (Binary Indexed Tree)
    Sparse Table for RMQ (Range Minimum Query)
    Disjoint Set Union (DSU) using arrays

13. Optimization & Patterns
    Meet-in-the-middle
    Divide and Conquer in array problems
    Binary Search on answer
    Monotonic stacks/queues with arrays
