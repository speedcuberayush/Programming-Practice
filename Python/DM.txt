TYPES OF GRAPH 
1. complete graph(Kn)
2. regular graph (same number of edges)
3. cycle graph (Cn)
4. graph containing cycle
5. wheel graph (Wn)
6. Bipartite graph, complete bipartite
7. star graph
8. complement

walk, trail(no repeat edge), path
connect (path exists), disconnected graph(path doesn't exist)
components




cut edge / bridge : remove a edge to make graph disconnected
cut edge set / cut set
edge cut / minimum cut (): min(num of cuts)

cut vertex/ cut point/ articulation point
: remove a vertex to make graph disconnected
cut vertex set
vertex set : removal of min num of vertices from a graph will make graph as disconnected graph


euler graph

trail
closed trail : start and end same vertex
euler cirxuit : cover all edges + start and end vertex
    degree of all vertex is even

euler line/trail : cover all edges exactly once but not end at start node


Hamilton 
path
closed path
Hamiltonian circuit


line graph is both
independent set : set of non adjacenet vertex
maximal independent set: cannot add	
independence no. : no of largest MIS

independent edge set (matching set): non adjacent edges



planar (no intersection of edge), 
non planar(intersection of edge)
K5 non planar
K33 non planar, regular graph
-1 edge is planar
