Flash Chip â†’ Dies â†’ Planes â†’ Blocks â†’ Pages â†’ Cells (bits)

Component	Meaning
Page	Smallest unit that can be read/written (~4â€“16 KB)
Block	Group of pages (typically 64â€“512 pages) â€“ smallest erase unit
Plane	Parallel array of blocks for faster access
Die	An independent NAND unit; multiple dies per chip
Cell	Stores 1 to 4 bits of data (SLC/MLC/TLC/QLC)

ðŸ”¹ 1. Flash Storage Fundamentals

video : Basics of NAND Flash (SLC, MLC, TLC, QLC)
video : SSD architecture: FTL (Flash Translation Layer), wear leveling, garbage collection, TRIM
gpt : Concepts of UFS, eMMC, NVMe, SATA, SCSI
gpt : Endurance, reliability, error handling (ECC, bad block management)

ðŸ”¹ 2. Protocols Knowledge (Host Interfaces)
You must understand how storage devices talk to the system.

gpt: Protocols to Study:
ðŸ“Œ eMMC, UFS (primary) 
SATA, SCSI, PCIe, NVMe (added advantage)

What to Focus On:
Command sequences, LUNs, Queues
How data is read/written/transferred
operation flow and list of common operations 
Use protocol analyzers (e.g., Lecroy, TotalPhase)

ðŸ”¹ 3. Firmware and Embedded Systems
You need to understand firmware algorithms in flash devices.

Topics:

gpt : Real-time embedded systems
gpt : RTOS basics, interrupts, scheduling
gpt : Boot process in flash devices
gpt : Data path inside firmware
gpt : Power loss management

ðŸ”¹ 4. Validation and Testing
Manual vs automated testing
Writing test cases for embedded devices
Regression testing, boundary testing
End-to-end scenarios: how firmware, hardware, and protocol work together

ðŸ”¹ 5. Debugging and Failure Analysis
You should be able to analyze trace logs and identify failures.

Tools to Study:
Protocol Analyzers (LeCroy CATC, TotalPhase, Logic Analyzer)
Logic analyzers, oscilloscopes (basic idea)
Trace viewers (internal at Sandisk, but understand general ones)


ðŸ”¹ 6. Software Development & Tools
gpt : Python: automation, data parsing, plotting
C/C++: understanding embedded code
Shell scripting: test setups, automation


ðŸ”¹ 7. System Knowledge
You must understand how the device interacts with various systems:

Study:

File systems: FAT32, exFAT, ext4 (common in mobile & industrial)

Mobile OS: Android device boot sequence and how UFS is used

Linux basics (for device validation environments)

dmesg, lsblk, iostat, smartctl

ðŸ”¹ 9. Bonus (Advanced Topics)
If time permits:

Signal integrity basics (for digital design understanding)
Power management in NAND systems
Thermal management and its effect on flash endurance
