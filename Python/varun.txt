1. LUN = Logical Unit Number.(book and chapters)
It identifies a specific logical unit (like a disk or partition) within a SCSI device.

Disk - where data is actually stored 
Ses - for security on Mac devices
VCD - is where FW image is burnt with custom keys for end user


2. Descriptors in USB
USB devices describe themselves using descriptors, which are structured data blocks.
Device, configuration, interface,endpoint,purpose 

3. TMIU = special instructions that let the host control

4. GSD vs UGSD (USB Mass Storage)

5.  Endpoints (USB): communication channel inside the USB device.
Control: For device configuration and commands.
Bulk: Large, non-time-critical data (e.g., storage read/write).
Interrupt: Small, time-sensitive transfers (e.g., keyboard/moue input).
Isochronous: Time-critical streaming (e.g., audio/video).
Each endpoint has a direction: IN (device → host) or OUT (host → device).

Here’s a clear breakdown of each term/concept you listed, tailored for storage and peripheral protocols (SCSI & USB), along with their role in data transfer and system communication:
1. LUNs in SCSI

LUN = Logical Unit Number.
It identifies a specific logical unit (like a disk or partition) within a SCSI device.
SCSI devices can have multiple LUNs; e.g., a storage array might expose 16 LUNs, each representing a different virtual disk.
Purpose: Allows the host to address and communicate with multiple storage units on a single SCSI target.


2. Descriptors in USB
USB devices describe themselves using descriptors, which are structured data blocks.
Device, configuration, interface,endpoint,purpose 

Types of descriptors:
Device descriptor: Info about the USB device (vendor ID, product ID, USB version, number of configurations).
Configuration descriptor: Details each configuration (power requirements, interfaces).
Interface descriptor: Describes a function or interface within the device.
Endpoint descriptor: Describes an endpoint’s type (bulk, interrupt, isochronous) and direction.
Purpose: Enables the host to know what the device is and how to communicate with it.

3. TMIU – Task Management Information Unit (SCSI)
Part of SCSI over transport protocols like iSCSI or USB Mass Storage.
TMIU handles task management functions such as:
Abort Task
Logical Unit Reset
Clear Task Set
Purpose: Allows the host to control or reset ongoing SCSI commands without corrupting the device state.

4. Resets
Reset types in storage/peripheral protocols:
Bus Reset: Resets the entire communication bus (e.g., USB or SCSI bus).
Target Reset / LUN Reset: Resets a specific device or logical unit.
Purpose: Recover from errors, abort stuck commands, or reinitialize device state.

5. GSD vs UGSD (USB Mass Storage)

6. Commands and their role
SCSI commands:
Examples: READ, WRITE, INQUIRY, TEST UNIT READY, REQUEST SENSE
Role: Define specific actions on the device (e.g., read data, write data, query status).
USB commands (via control transfers):
Examples: GET_DESCRIPTOR, SET_CONFIGURATION, CLEAR_FEATURE
Role: Control device setup, configuration, and features.
Commands are the language the host uses to interact with the device.

7. Endpoints (USB)

Endpoint: A uniquely addressable channel on a USB device for data transfer.

Types of endpoints:
Control: For device configuration and commands.
Bulk: Large, non-time-critical data (e.g., storage read/write).
Interrupt: Small, time-sensitive transfers (e.g., keyboard/moue input).
Isochronous: Time-critical streaming (e.g., audio/video).
Each endpoint has a direction: IN (device → host) or OUT (host → device).
Purpose: Organize data flow and allow simultaneous communication streams.

If you want, I can make a single diagram showing SCSI LUNs, USB descriptors, endpoints, TMIUs, and commands together — it’s much easier to visualize how they interact.

Do you want me to do that?

Ah, perfect — you’re talking about a multi-LUN USB or SCSI storage device where each LUN serves a specific purpose. Let me break it down clearly in context with your product:
